// The GitHub Actions gates, watched failing.
//
// ACT001 and ACT002 are shell, and shell gates fail in the direction that reports success: an awk
// pattern that stops matching reports "no findings" over a file it never read, and looks exactly
// like a clean tree. That is not hypothetical — in the repository this gate was ported from, the
// first version of ACT001 matched only `run: |`, so `run: echo "${{ github.ref_name }}"` walked
// past the gate whose entire purpose is that line, green all the way.
//
// So these tests point the gate at deliberately broken workflows and require it to fire. They are
// the reason scripts/act-gates.sh takes a directory instead of hard-coding .github/workflows, and
// they are ported alongside the scanner: carrying the gate across without the tests that watched it
// fail would be carrying the half that cannot be trusted.

// actGate runs one gate over a directory of fixtures and returns its exit code and output.
